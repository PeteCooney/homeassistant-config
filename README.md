## Future Plans

I'm currently buying a new house so will likely need to update/change a lot of the existing configuration. I also have "plans" to do a more IoT in the new house including:

- Shelly relays in as many light switches as possible
- Integrate CCTV cameras with Home Assistant, assuming they can be supported (if not, I may just have to invest in a UniFi Dream Machine)
